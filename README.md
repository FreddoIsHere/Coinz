19/10/2018 Coins can be collected. Coins can get exchanged. Limit of 25 Coins to exchange not set yet. Might be a bit buggy still.
25/10/2018 Trading is now possible, Bug fixed that led to the app crashing when looking at the past coin exchangerates for the first time in a day, 25 coin limit set, design fixes
30/10/2018 Bug fixed where the wallet was not properly updated, Event added where the player chases a moving sac filled with a random amount of coins against the time, Depot and Map-activity are now created with the start of the application
