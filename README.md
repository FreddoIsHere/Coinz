Before 19/10/2018 Design decisions were realised, plan outlayed
19/10/2018 Coins can be collected. Coins can get exchanged. Limit of 25 Coins to exchange not set yet. Might be a bit buggy still.
25/10/2018 Trading is now possible, Bug fixed that led to the app crashing when looking at the past coin exchangerates for the first time in a day, 25 coin limit set, design fixes
30/10/2018 Bug fixed where the wallet was not properly updated, Event added where the player chases a moving sac filled with a random amount of coins against the time, Depot and Map-activity are now created with the start of the application
19/11/2018 Last Bonus feature implemented: There are two teams who players can buy zones for in Edinburgh/ Players will only be able to collect coins in the zones their team owns/zones can be bought with gold, Settings fragment is set up, App is essentially completed, Tests are left to write
25/11/2018 A couple of design changes, minor bug fixes, cleaning up code (commenting, reformating, removing warnings)
27/11/2018 Tests were added, minor comment changes, bug fix where the bar plot in the account tab did not show
