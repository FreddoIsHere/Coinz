Before 19/10/2018 Design decisions were realised, plan outlayed
19/10/2018 Coins can be collected. Coins can get exchanged. Limit of 25 Coins to exchange not set yet. Might be a bit buggy still.
25/10/2018 Trading is now possible, Bug fixed that led to the app crashing when looking at the past coin exchangerates for the first time a day, 25 coin limit set, design fixes


IMPORTANT NOTE: Please grant your location permissions before opening the app for the first time. The app will only request location permissions for the next time you open the app. This is a simple measurement taken to avoid potential bugs following mid game permission changes.
